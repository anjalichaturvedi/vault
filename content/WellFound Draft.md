As a passionate and dedicated computer science student at Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, I have developed a solid foundation in various programming languages, frameworks, and tools that align perfectly with the requirements outlined in your job posting.

What separates me from other candidates is my unique blend of technical expertise and hands-on experience. Through internships at Instapreps AI and the Rehabilitation Society of the Visually Impaired, I have honed my skills in full-stack web development, leveraging technologies such as React, Node.js, and module CSS. I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality products that enhance user experience and drive business growth.

Furthermore, my involvement in hackathons organized by Nodebrew, where I led teams of over 1600 participants from 46 countries, has equipped me with exceptional leadership, teamwork, and project management abilities. I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments and excel at transforming complex requirements into innovative and user-friendly solutions.

In addition to my technical prowess, I am passionate about leveraging technology to create positive social impact. My project "Campus Navigator" demonstrates my ability to develop intuitive and accessible applications that streamline processes and enhance the user experience for diverse communities.

I am confident that my skills, experience, and enthusiasm make me an ideal candidate for this internship opportunity
